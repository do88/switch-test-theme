See below on how I would like this project to be set out:

1. Use any local development tool of your choosing, ie wamp, mamp docker etc.
2. The site must be built in Wordpress
3. Advanced Custom Fields must be used and everything should be editable apart from the logo that you can hardcode as text
4. The final version must also be responsive through major breakpoints. Monitor, laptop, tablet, mobile phone
5. Sass must be used for stylesheets
6. Images must be responsive as well as optimized. You can see that the images in the assets folder are way too large to be used in production.
7. When completed, share the url with us as well as login details to WP Admin. You can host the website on any host of your choosing but for this scenario I would recommend going with 000webhost, its completely free!
